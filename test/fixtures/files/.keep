<!-- Fixtures are a way of organizing test data; they reside in the fixtures directory.

A jobs directory will also be created when an associated test is first generated.

The test_helper.rb file holds the default configuration for your tests.

The application_system_test_case.rb holds the default configuration for your system tests. -->
